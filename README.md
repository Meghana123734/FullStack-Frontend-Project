# Project Title: SMART BILLING & INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# Project Concept:
To build a frontend web application that simulates the process of managing inventory and generating bills for businesses.
This web application prototype, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focuses on demonstrating the UI/UX of billing operations.
Its core functionality is dynamic product handling and real-time bill generation, allowing users to select products, apply discounts, and instantly view totals. The prototype includes client-side calculations and interactive elements that help visualize how a complete billing system would function.

# Features Implemented in this Frontend Version
I have implemented the below features in this current frontend version:

Visually Consistent and Responsive Design:
The layout for product management and billing pages offers a clean, professional interface that works across different screen sizes.

Dynamic Product Handling:
Users can add and view products in the inventory, and the data is fetched dynamically in the billing section for creating bills.

Real-Time Bill Calculation:
Subtotal, discount, and total amount are updated instantly as the user selects products or modifies quantities.

Invoice Generation:
A professional invoice layout is generated with customer details, billing summary, and a unique barcode.

# Future Plans (Backend Integration)
I want to make this web application more functional and secure in the future. My plans include:

Database Integration:
Connecting the app to a database (SQL/MongoDB) to store products, bills, and customer details securely.

User Authentication:
Adding secure login for store owners or staff to manage inventory and generate bills safely.

Invoice History & Tracking:
Saving all invoices in the backend for easy access and business record-keeping.

Automated Notifications:
Sending invoice copies to customers through email or SMS after billing.
